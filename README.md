## Development

This section contains information for developers who want to contribute to this project.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) - Python package manager

### Setup Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hannoeru/hass-nature-remo.git
   cd hass-nature-remo
   ```

2. **Install uv** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

3. **Set up virtual environment and install dependencies**
   ```bash
   uv sync --dev
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

### Development Tools

This project uses several development tools to maintain code quality:

#### Code Linting and Formatting

- **Ruff** - Fast Python linter and formatter
  ```bash
  # Check for linting issues
  uv run ruff check

  # Fix auto-fixable issues
  uv run ruff check --fix

  # Format code
  uv run ruff format
  ```

#### Type Checking

- **mypy** - Static type checker
  ```bash
  uv run mypy .
  ```

#### Testing

- **pytest** - Testing framework
  ```bash
  # Run all tests
  uv run pytest

  # Run tests with coverage
  uv run pytest --cov

  # Run specific test file
  uv run pytest tests/test_specific.py
  ```

### Project Structure

```

### Adding New Features

1. **Follow Home Assistant development patterns** - Refer to the [Home Assistant Developer Documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/)

2. **Add type annotations** - All new code should include proper type hints

3. **Write tests** - Add tests for new functionality in the `tests/` directory

4. **Run quality checks** before committing:
   ```bash
   # Run all checks
   uv run ruff check --fix
   uv run ruff format
   uv run mypy .
   uv run pytest
   ```

### Debugging

For debugging the integration:

1. **Enable debug logging** in your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   logger:
     default: info
     logs:
       custom_components.nature_remo: debug
   ```

2. **Use Home Assistant's developer tools** to inspect entity states and attributes

3. **Check Home Assistant logs** for any error messages related to the integration

### Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes following the development guidelines above
4. Run all quality checks
5. Submit a pull request

### Home Assistant Integration Testing

To test the integration with Home Assistant:

1. **Install Home Assistant** in a development environment
2. **Copy the integration** to your `custom_components` directory
3. **Add the configuration** to your `configuration.yaml`
4. **Restart Home Assistant** and check the logs for any issues
